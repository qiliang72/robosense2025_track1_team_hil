      "question": "In this scenario, what are safe actions to take for the ego vehicle?",
      "answer": "### Safe Actions:\n1. **Reduce Speed and Maintain Distance:** Given the wet road conditions, reducing speed and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles will help prevent hydroplaning and allow more time to react to any sudden changes in traffic.\n2. **Follow Traffic Signals:** The traffic lights are visible and should be strictly followed. Stopping at red lights and proceeding with caution on green lights ensures compliance with traffic rules and safety.\n3. **Use Wipers and Lights:** Activating the windshield wipers to maintain clear visibility and turning on headlights or fog lights to improve visibility for both the driver and other road users.\n\n### Dangerous Actions:\n1. **Rapid Acceleration or Braking:** Sudden movements can cause loss of traction on wet roads, increasing the risk of skidding or losing control of the vehicle.\n2. **Ignoring Traffic Signals:** Running red lights or not yielding when required can lead to collisions, especially in an urban environment with multiple intersections and pedestrian crossings.\n3. **Distracted Driving:** Engaging in activities like using a phone or adjusting settings while driving can divert attention from the road, which is particularly risky in rainy conditions with reduced visibility.\n\n### Note:\nThe rain and wet roads require extra caution. Drivers should focus on maintaining control of their vehicle and being aware of their surroundings to ensure safe navigation through the city.",
