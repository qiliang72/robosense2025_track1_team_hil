Maintaining a safe speed is crucial.\n\n2. **Tailgating**: Keeping a safe distance from other vehicles is important because braking distances increase on wet roads. Tailgating increases the risk of rear-ending another vehicle if they brake suddenly.\n\n3. **Sharp Turns**: Making sharp turns at high speeds can cause the vehicle to skid, especially on wet surfaces.\n\n4. **Distracted Driving**: Being distracted by anything inside or outside",

Speeding increases the risk of skidding or losing control.\n\n2. **Tailgating**: Following the white car too closely (as seen in Image 6) can be dangerous because it reduces reaction time if the car ahead brakes suddenly.\n\n3. **Ignoring Traffic Signals**: Failing to obey traffic lights, such as the green light in Image 4, can lead to accidents with oncoming traffic or pedestrians.\n\n4. **Sudden",

Maintaining a safe speed is crucial.\n\n2. **Tailgating**: Keeping a safe distance from other vehicles is important because braking distances increase on wet roads. Tailgating increases the risk of rear-ending another vehicle if they brake suddenly.\n\n3. **Sharp Turns**: Making sharp or sudden turns can cause the vehicle to skid, especially on wet surfaces. Smooth and gradual steering is safer.\n\n4. **Ignoring Traffic Signals and Signs**:",

    "question": "In this scenario, what are safe actions to take for the ego vehicle?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the ego vehicle should take the following safe actions:\n\n1. **Reduce Speed**: The road appears wet, which can make it slippery and increase stopping distances. Reducing speed will help maintain better control of the vehicle.\n\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: Given the wet conditions, increasing the distance from the car in front will provide more time to react if the vehicle ahead brakes suddenly.\n\n3. **Use Headlights**: Even though it is daytime, using headlights can improve visibility for other drivers, especially in rainy conditions.\n\n4. **Stay in Lane**: Maintain a steady lane position and avoid sudden lane changes, as the wet",

    "question": "In this scenario, what are dangerous actions to take for the ego vehicle?",
    "answer": "In this rainy urban driving scenario, several actions could be considered dangerous for the ego vehicle:\n\n1. **Speeding**: The wet roads reduce traction, making it easier to skid or lose control. Maintaining a safe speed is crucial.\n\n2. **Tailgating**: Keeping a safe distance from other vehicles is important because braking distances increase on wet roads. Tailgating increases the risk of rear-ending another vehicle if they brake suddenly.\n\n3. **Sharp Turns**: Making sharp or sudden turns can cause the vehicle to skid, especially on wet surfaces. Smooth and gradual steering is safer.\n\n4. **Ignoring Traffic Signals**: Failing",

There are traffic barriers on the right side, indicating some construction or maintenance work. A few vehicles are visible on the road, including a truck on the left side.\n- **Buildings**: On the left side, there is a large building with a modern design, featuring a curved roof structure. In the background, there are several tall buildings",

However, since the question asks for the \"moving status,\" we need to consider what it will do next once the light changes.\n\nThe most likely action for a vehicle stopped at a red light is to go",

Tailgating can lead to rear-end collisions if the vehicle in front suddenly stops.\n\n3. **Sharp Turns**: Making sharp or sudden turns can cause the vehicle to skid, especially on wet surfaces.

Reducing speed can help maintain better control of the vehicle.\n\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: Given the wet conditions, increasing the distance from other vehicles can provide more time to react in case of sudden stops or changes in traffic.\n\n3. **Use Headlights**: Turn on headlights to improve visibility for both the driver and other road users, even if it is daytime.\n\n4. **Avoid Sudden Movements**: Make smooth and gradual steering, acceleration, and braking movements to avoid sk",

Wet roads increase stopping distances.\n\n3. **Sharp Turns**: Making sharp or sudden turns can cause the vehicle to skid, especially on wet surfaces.\n\n4. **Ignoring Traffic Signs**: Failing to obey traffic signs, such as stop signs or no stopping zones, can lead",

Here are some dangerous actions that the ego vehicle should avoid:\n\n1. **Speeding**: The bridge appears to be relatively empty, which might tempt the driver to speed. However, speeding can lead to loss of control, especially if there are sudden changes in road conditions or unexpected obstacles.\n\n2. **Distracted Driving**: Engaging in activities such as using a phone, eating, or adjusting the radio while driving can divert attention from the road, increasing the risk of accidents.\n\n3. **Tailgating**: Following too",

Stopping ensures safety and compliance with traffic rules.\n   - **Probability:** High (80%)\n\n2. **Continue Driving:**\n   - **Reason:** If the vehicle is already in motion and the yellow light",

    "question": "What's your comment on this scene?",
    "answer": "This scene appears to be set in an urban area with a mix of historical and modern architecture. The buildings are primarily brick, suggesting a historic or industrial past, while the presence of modern signage and vehicles indicates contemporary use. The street is relatively quiet, with a few cars parked along the sides and some pedestrians walking. The overall atmosphere seems calm and orderly, typical of a city center or downtown area during a non-peak hour. The presence of a bus lane suggests that public transportation is an important part of the local infrastructure. The large building in the background with a unique design adds a modern touch to the otherwise traditional setting.",

Here are some safe actions to take:\n\n1. **Reduce Speed**: Wet roads can be slippery, so reducing speed will help maintain better control of the vehicle and allow for longer stopping distances.\n\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: Leave more space between your vehicle and the one in front of you to account for reduced traction and longer braking distances.\n\n3. **Use Headlights**: Turn on headlights to improve visibility for yourself and other drivers, even if it's not completely dark.\n\n4. **Avoid Sudden Movements**: Make",

    "answer": "In the given scenario, the ego vehicle is driving through a rainy and wet environment with reduced visibility. Here are some dangerous actions to avoid:\n\n1. **Speeding**: The wet roads can be slippery, increasing the risk of skidding or losing control. Maintaining a safe speed is crucial.\n\n2. **Tailgating**: Keeping a safe distance from other vehicles is important because braking distances increase on wet roads. Tailgating can lead to rear-end collisions if the vehicle in front suddenly stops.\n\n3. **Sharp Turns**: Making sharp turns at high speeds can cause the vehicle to skid, especially on wet surfaces.

Tailgating can lead to rear-end collisions if the vehicle in front suddenly stops.\n\n3. **Ignoring Traffic Signals and Signs**: The presence of stop signs, pedestrian crossings, and construction zones requires extra attention.

Reducing speed helps maintain better control of the vehicle.\n\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: With reduced traction, stopping distances increase. Keeping a greater distance from the vehicle ahead provides more time to react to any sudden stops.\n\n3. **Use Headlights**: Even if it's daytime, using headlights improves visibility for both the driver and other road users.\n\n4. **Avoid Sudden Movements**: Smooth and gradual steering, acceleration, and braking help",
